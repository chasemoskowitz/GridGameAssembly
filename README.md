"# GridGameAssembly" 


This program is a game that uses a 2D array to make a gird of rows and columns. The point of the game is to pick up as much candy as possible. 
The way to do that is to select a row and column, and you will collect 80% of the candy in that specified position.
When you chose to finish, the game will tell you how many times you picked up the candy off the floor, how much candy you picked up, and the average amount of candy picked up per gathering.



To run this game, the Irvine folder should be placed in root of C: drive
